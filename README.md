PwnedCast-OTA
=============

an OTA update engine for rooted Google Ghromecasts

This is a work in progress, and should not be used at this time.

<b>Disclaimer:</b>

This software will report your serial # and build # to my server. The reason for this is so I can do rolling updates, track unique installs, and flag select devices for test images. If you wish to disable this software, read more in the release thread on XDA.
