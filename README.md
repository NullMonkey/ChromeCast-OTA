PwnedCast-OTA
=============

an OTA update engine for rooted Google Ghromecasts

This is a work in progress, and should not be used at this time.

<b>Disclaimer:</b>

This software will report your serial # and build # of your chromecast device to my server. The reason I require your serial # is so I can track the number of unique installs, as well as do roll-out updates to prevent everyone from downloading at once. Another nice feature is it allows me to define "dev" devices for test images.
