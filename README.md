ChromeCast-OTA
=============

an OTA update engine for rooted Google Ghromecasts

This is still in development, but should be considered stable enough for daily use.

<b>How To Use:</b>

This is included in all of ddggttff3's and Team Eureka's released rooted images on XDA.

If you are a ROM developer and want to use this code, it needs to be called from clear_crash_counter as it requires running as root.

<b>Disclaimer:</b>

This software will report a hash of your serial # and build # to the ROM providers. Your raw serial # is not reported at any time during the use of this software.
