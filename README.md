PwnedCast-OTA
=============

an OTA update engine for rooted Google Ghromecasts

This is a constant work in progress, but currently is considered STABLE.

<b>How To Use:</b>

This is included in all of my released rooted images on XDA after 10/26/2013, and will run automatically.

<b>Disclaimer:</b>

This software will report a hash of your serial # and build # to my server. The reason for this is so I can do rolling updates, track unique installs, and flag select devices for test images. If you wish to disable this software, read more in the release thread on XDA.

Your raw serial # is not reported at any time during the use of this software.
