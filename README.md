PwnedCast-OTA
=============

an OTA update engine for rooted Google Ghromecasts

This is still in development, but should be considered stable enough for daily use.

<b>How To Use:</b>

This is included in all of my released rooted images on XDA after 11/1/2013, and will run automatically.

If you are a ROM developer and want to use this code, it needs to be called from clear_flash_counter as it requires running as root. Do not forget to put it in a infinite loop incase it exits with an error.,

<b>Disclaimer:</b>

This software will report a hash of your serial # and build # to my server. The reason for this is so I can do rolling updates, track unique installs, and flag select devices for test images. If you wish to disable this software, read more in the release thread on XDA.

Your raw serial # is not reported at any time during the use of this software.
